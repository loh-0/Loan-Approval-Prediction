# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction App

This project is a **machine learning-powered web application** that predicts whether a loan will be approved based on user inputs such as income, employment status, credit score, and asset values. The app also uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to explain how each input feature contributed to the model's decision.

Built with:
- 🎯 **Random Forest Classifier**
- 🧠 **SHAP for model explainability**
- 💻 **Streamlit** for the interactive user interface

## 🚀 Features

- 🔮 **Real-time loan approval prediction** based on financial and personal attributes
- 🧩 **SHAP visualizations** (force plot, waterfall, bar plot) to interpret why a loan was approved or rejected
- 🔁 **What-If simulator** to see how changing certain inputs like CIBIL score or income might impact outcomes
- 📊 **Interactive summary** of how each input feature affected the model's decision
- 📋 **Rule-based recommendations** for improving loan approval chances
- 🎯 **Priority action items** highlighting the most impactful areas for improvement

## ⚠️ Important Data Limitations

**This is a proof-of-concept project with significant data limitations that users should understand:**

### 🎯 Feature Dominance Issue
- The dataset exhibits **extreme correlation** with **CIBIL score** and **loan term** - these two features essentially determine 90%+ of predictions
- Other features like:
  - Asset values (residential, commercial, luxury, bank)
  - Number of dependents
  - Education level
  - Employment status
  - Annual income (to a lesser extent)
  
  Have **minimal predictive power** due to poor data quality or weak correlations in the training dataset.

### 📊 What This Means
- **Unrealistic scenarios**: You might see cases where someone with excellent income and assets gets rejected solely due to CIBIL score
- **Limited feature diversity**: The model essentially becomes a "CIBIL score + loan term" predictor
- **Oversimplified decisions**: Real-world loan decisions consider many more nuanced factors

### 🧪 Why This Happened
This is a common issue in ML projects with:
- **Synthetic or limited datasets** that don't capture real-world complexity
- **Feature engineering challenges** where some features weren't properly scaled or encoded
- **Data collection bias** where certain features were more reliably recorded than others

> **Bottom Line**: This app demonstrates **ML workflow, model interpretability, and deployment techniques** rather than providing realistic loan predictions. It's an educational tool showcasing end-to-end ML development, not a financial advisory system.

## 📈 Model Performance Notes

While the model achieves reasonable accuracy metrics on the training/test data, the **real-world applicability is limited** due to:

1. **Feature imbalance**: CIBIL score dominates predictions
2. **Limited feature diversity**: Other features contribute minimally
3. **Potential overfitting**: Model may be too specialized to the training data patterns

### Key Metrics
- The model performs well on validation data but suffers from feature dependency issues
- SHAP analysis consistently shows CIBIL score as the primary driver (often 70-90% of decision weight)
- Other features typically contribute <10% each to final predictions
